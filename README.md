# CO2 emissions analysis in Europe
This project is dedicated to the analysis of CO2 emissions across various European countries. Using data science techniques and tools such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, this repository offers a detailed examination of CO2 emission trends, correlations with economic indicators, and predictive modeling to understand future impacts.
## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for robust analysis.
- Visualizations to explore emission distributions and trends over time.
- Regression analysis to predict emissions based on economic factors.
- Detailed documentation and examples for each analysis step.
## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the required dependencies via pip:
